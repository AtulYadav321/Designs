This GitHub repository is a showcase of my work as a Creative Marketer, where I blend my expertise in digital marketing, visual arts, and web development.
It have the websites that I have developed, graphic design work such as posters and infographics, and detailed marketing campaigns I have executed.
Each project highlights my proficiency in web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside my experience with design tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, as well as platforms such as Canva.
In addition, I incorporate digital marketing strategies and analytical tools, including Google Analytics, to drive traffic and enhance user engagement.
